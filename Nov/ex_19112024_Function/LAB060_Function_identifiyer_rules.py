#Function should start with only A to Z not valid with Special or Number.

'''
def 123():# not valid because fo the number name should not be valid


Also, indentation is more important in python
Like
def H():
    print("Hello") # Part of function because indentation below the function

print("Demo") #Not a part of function because of the indentation.
'''

def H():
    print("Hello")
H()
